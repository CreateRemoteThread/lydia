This is an extremely bare-bones tool, meant for interfacing with LLM's while keeping the token count down, and providing granular visibility / customisation around tool calls.

To get started, see [quickstart](docs/QUICKSTART.md).

Use the following command line args:
```
- -i/--interactive: interactive mode (i.e. chat interface)
- -c/--cfg: use a config file
- -p/--prompt: set the prompt
- -m/--model: set the model
- -t/--tool: load a single tool
- --mcp "cmdline": start an mcp
- --mcp "http://url_goes_here": start an http mcp
- --mcp-deny "arg": deny a single tool from all mcps. must be called after --mcp
- -r/--reasoning <low/medium/high>: enable reasoning where available. this is not always required - check your inference provider.
- -a/--agentic: experimental. load a json file for hatchery mode
- --toolbox <name>: load a set of tools that start with name
- --persona <persona/name.md>: replace system prompt with persona
```

You can set the following environment variables (note that these are overridden by -c's configuration file):
```
- SSL_VERIFY (set to anything but "True" to disable requests ssl verification)
- STFU (set to anything to remove the ask_user tool from default context)
- TURNS_KEPT (configure how long to keep memory, default 6 turns)
- MCP_CREDFILE (points to comma separated list of url,bearer token)
- CMD_FW (comma-separated allowed commands for shell_ tools)
- OPENAI_BASE_URL
- OPENAI_API_KEY
- OPENAI_DEFAULT_MODEL
- DEBUG_REQUESTS (set to any value to enable dumping requests)
- DEBUG_MEMORY (set to any value to enable debugging memory)
- X_PORTKEY_PROVIDER (if you're using portkey)
- FN_PREFIX
  - The "file sandbox" is this env var (comma-separated) + /tmp, /var/tmp, /private/tmp + current directory.
  - All file_ tools are constrained to this directory.
  - By default, this tool is able to create, edit, delete anything in it's cwd
- VM_SSHARGS (set to ssh lol@lolhost, this prefixes any shell_exec commands)
- I_ACCEPT_THE_RISK (set to "ISO27001" to run commands locally, overrides VM_SSHARGS)
- YELLOW_BRICK_ROAD (set to "ISO31000" to auto-approve all commands. if you use this and ai deletes your labubus, that's on you)
- OFF_WITH_HER_HEAD (set to anything to enable experimental anthropic support. todo: tidy up code, make a new agent class to handle Anthropic API)
- ANTHROPIC_MAX_TOKENS (required by anthropic, defaults 64000)
```

You probably shouldn't be here, you probably want /r/vibecoding instead.
